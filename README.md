The purpose of this report is to create a summary of the key metric of total fares for ride sharing data by city type. The data given was in two different datasets with one containing individual ride information and the other containing driver information. The datasets were combined to observe total fares over time for each of the three city times: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. The attached figure summarizes the findings.

From the findings it can be seen that Urban Cities have the highest total fares over time, ranging approximately from $2000 to $2500 per day. This is followed by Suburban Cities with the second highest total fares over time, typically ranging from $750 to $1500 per day, and Rural Cities with the lowest total fares over time, ranging about $100 to $500 per day.


The second paragraph should include the following:

What challenges or difficulties did you encounter? If none, then briefly explain what challenges or difficulties may be encountered and how to avoid them using technical analysis.
Explain how you overcame any challenges or difficulties, and include what technical analysis you use to overcome the challenges or difficulties.




The third paragraph should include the following:

Based on the data from the different city types, what recommendations would you give the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types?
Provide two additional analyses you could do to gain more insight into the data, like using other datasets.
What technical steps would you take to perform the additional analyses?
